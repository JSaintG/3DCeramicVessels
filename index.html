                <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p>This site documents a course project in Digital Humanities
                    to 3D model a selection of cultural heritage objects. We tested a variety of methods and tools for
                    creating and processing these 3D models, and discuss the pros and cons of each in the <a
                            href="#portfolio">Methods</a> section of the site. For the purposes of this project, we
                    chose to model a small sample of Mississippian ceramic effigy vessels from the collection of the
                    Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University Bloomington.</p>
                    <p>Effigy vessels are one of the hallmarks of the pre-Columbian Mississippian era (~800CE – 1600CE).
                        Humans, mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and even mythological creatures were modeled in a
                        variety of styles and vessel forms.
                        Styles range from including one or more adornments that suggest certain effigy features, such as
                        a head and tail attached to opposite sides of a bowl rim, to entire bottles and bowls formed
                        into the shape of a head or body. Because these vessels often contain asymmetrical features,
                        they can be best appreciated and studied by viewing them from all angles and sides. The creation
                        of digital 3D models allows the public to dynamically view and engage with these artifacts in
                        ways not otherwise possible when presented either in exhibit cases or in static 2D photographs.
                        Researchers can also measure, analyze, and reconstruct these models in new and innovative
                        ways.</p></h3>

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p>There are a number of methods currently in use for
                    capturing 3D data as well as a growing number of software programs and techniques for processing and
                    editing models. Choosing among them involves evaluating data capture and processing time, technician
                    budgeting, equipment and software costs, and necessary access to processing hardware. The size,
                    format, material, location, and portability of objects also need to be considered. 3D projects
                    should start with specific requirements in mind including the intended goals or research questions
                    that may be addressed with the final product. Will the models need to represent fine detail and be
                    rendered as accurately at possible for scientific measurement and analysis? Or are they intended
                    mainly for public exhibition or educational purposes?</p>
                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">For this project, we employed two methods of data capture:
                        photogrammetry and structured light scanning. We will discuss these approaches and highlight the
                        strengths and limitations of both. We will also discuss differences in the rendering and editing
                        software available for these methods.</p></h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                <h3>Photogrammetry</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Multi-image photogrammetry is a 3D modeling technique that uses multiple 2D images of
                    an object to record, measure, and match corresponding points on an object in order to build a 3D
                    representation. Typically a series of images that incorporate overlapping views are taken from high,
                    mid, and low angles of the object in order to record and match as many points on the surface of the
                    object as possible. Two methods of capturing these images are to rotate the object 360 degrees in
                    front of a static camera position (except for changes in camera height and angle) or for the camera
                    to move 360 degrees around the static object. Which method is used will depend on the size and
                    portability of the object, as well as lighting conditions, space constraints, and modeling software
                    preferences. All of the models used for this project were small enough for us to experiment with
                    both techniques.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p>For the purposes of this project we started out using the <a
                            href="https://remake.autodesk.com/about">AutoDesk ReMake</a>
                        processing software. ReMake is offered free for students and educators, has some handy built-in
                        editing features, and can be processed fairly easily and quickly using the cloud-based build
                        option. However, ReMake has some drawbacks in its sensitivity to image background information.
                        Of the two techniques for camera position, the moving camera method initially produced cleaner,
                        more accurate meshes. Images taken while the photographer moves around the object will capture
                        changing background information. This allows ReMake to match overlapping points and reconstruct
                        the field of view with more accuracy.</p>
                    <p>For our testing of the alternative method, where the object is rotated instead, we
                        used a turntable and professional light-tent. ReMake and other processing programs seem to be
                        particularly sensitive to the changes, or lack of changes, in the background of an object using
                        this method. To get the best results, a uniform and monochromatic backdrop needs to be used.
                        Turntables should also be covered in the same color material, and both should contrast enough
                        with the color of the object in order for the processing software to distinguish it
                        properly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                    <h5>Ethofoam Support</h5>
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/ethofoamt.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p>Another major consideration in our project was the need to capture images of both
                        the top and bottom of the vessels in order to view models from any angle. Although we were able
                        to use pre-made ethofoam supports to invert vessels in a few cases, more asymmetrical artifacts
                        required the use of custom-made supports (made by GBL staff) to capture data on their
                        bases.</p>
                    <p>ReMake is limited in that it cannot process or merge both upright and inverted
                        model images into one mesh. Two models, top and bottom, must be created separately in ReMake and
                        then exported into another program, such as <a href="http://pixologic.com/">Pixologic's ZBrush</a>, to create a merged model. ZBrush is a powerful digital modeling and sculpting program, but can be prohibitively expensive and has a steep learning curve. ZBrush also does not offer a point matching feature which makes it
                        difficult to properly size, rotate, and align two objects into one seamless model.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.agisoft.com/">Agisoft PhotoScan</a>is another software program that can be
                        used to process images
                        and generate 3D models. This program allows you to import both top and bottom image series and
                        create a single merged model without having to export files into ZBrush or other editing
                        software. PhotoScan provides a tool for selecting matching points along the surface of the model
                        in both series in order to more accurately align the two meshes.</p>

                        <p>PhotoScan is more expensive to purchase than ReMake, only offering a 30 day
                            free trial of its basic version and no long-term free versions for students or educators. It
                            also requires a lot of processing power and processing time, depending on the quality
                            desired for the final model. We processed a version of the Turtle Effigy in PhotoScan
                            using a lower quality setting based on the time and resources available to us. The result is
                            adequate for exhibition and educational purposes at this point, but may not be accurate or
                            photorealistic enough for detailed research and analysis.</p>

                            to reconstruct geometric representations of the object. Color and texture detail are also
                            captured by a camera sensor built into the scanner. A Creaform Go!SCAN 50 scanner was used
                            to model 3 objects from our project, which we used to compare with the versions created with
                            photogrammetry. As in other methods of data capture, the material, lighting, and shape of
                            the object must be taken into consideration. Highly reflective or translucent materials can
                            create confusion about the precise location of an object's surface.</p>
                        <p>Objects that are too symmetrical are also a problem, as the scanner may not find enough
                            different points to properly align the image data. Special adhesive point markers can be
                            placed on the turntable or object in these cases to help identify points.</p>
                        <p>As in PhotoScan, the Creaform software that comes with the Go!SCAN allows the user to clean
                            and edit extraneous data and includes a point matching system for aligning upright and
                            inverted model data.</p>

                    <p>The combined Go!SCAN data capture and processing steps provide for a faster and
                        more streamlined workflow for 3D modeling. However, structured light scanners are a far more
                        expensive option than photogrammetry equipment, with the Go!SCAN 50 currently costing around
                        $25,000. We also felt that the results from our photogrammetry versions were far more accurate
                        in terms of surface detail and texture. In the <a href="#models">Models</a> section of this
                        site, you can reference a color-corrected image of the effigy vessel, representing the vessel's
                        true color, along side the models produced by photogrammetry and structured light scanning. </p>

                        <h3>Other considerations:</h3>


                        <h5>Image format jpeg vs. RAW/Tiff</h5>
                    </div>
                    <p>For this project, we captured our images in RAW, but processed all of our
                        photogrammetry models using the jpeg file format. Although we would like to experiment with
                        tiffs converted from RAW in the future, these large files require more powerful processing
                        hardware and longer processing times. A few experts we spoke with (Jeff Rogers & Matt Brennan)
                        also indicated that sometimes higher resolution images can also introduce extra noise that may
                        make it difficult for processing software to stitch images together.</p>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                        <h5>Lighting and camera settings</h5>
                    </div>
                    <p>Often the most time-consuming element of our photogrammetry process was selecting
                        the proper lighting and camera settings for image capture. Because we were shooting indoors, we
                        needed to balance having enough even overhead lighting for reasonable exposure times without
                        creating glare on the surface of the objects. Larger aperture settings are also required to
                        capture sufficient depth of field and insure that all surfaces of the object are in focus. As
                        this also reduces the amount of light available to the camera sensor, we used tripods and cable
                        shutter releases in order to set longer exposure times. </p>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            <h5>Color</h5>
                        </div>
                        <p>It's important to note that color texture maps of one object can have many different
                            appearances. While objects for this project were photographed/scanned in the same room and
                            under the same lighting, there are clear variations amongst each method. Color accuracy will
                            ultimately depend on the purpose of a 3D asset. For acientific measurement and analysis or
                            archival purposes, objects should always be photographed with a color chart to correct for
                            white balance in post-processing.</p>

                <p>Metadata, or data about data, is essential to describing, identifying, linking, and even re-creating
                    digital products. At this time, there is no single, widely-adopted schema standard for capturing and
                    sharing 3D object metadata. Many projects develop their own in-house standards depending on the type
                    of objects and modeling processes involved. A few of the more well-known schemas that do capture 3D
                    object and modeling metadata are CARARE, CRMdig, and ADS (Archaeological Data Service). In-house,
                    non-standardized metadata can potentially be mapped to these schemas for harvesting and
                    interoperability with cultural heritage portal sites such as Europeana. However, many of these
                    larger standards are extensive and exhaustive in terms of the number of fields that can be captured.
                    For our purposes, we developed a more light-weight schema that overlaps with many of these larger
                    standards but also focuses more closely on categories of data we felt were more important for our
                    project.</p>
                <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                    <p>The main categories of metadata we captured are:</p>

                    <p>Data Capture</p>

                <p class="indent">We currently have 67 fields included under these categories, and we will continuing to
                    refine and adjust this schema going forward. Full metadata records for the models produced for this
                    project are available in spreadsheet format. We will also be adding to and adjusting this document
                    as we continue to clean and process additional 3D models.</p>
